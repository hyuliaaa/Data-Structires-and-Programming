# Binary Search Tree
- binary tree in which for every node all the elements in the left subtree are smaller than that node and all the elements in the right subtree are greater
- useful for searching a tree in less number of comparisons
## Properties
- BST does not have duplicates
- inorder traversal(left,root,right) gives the elements in sorted order
- for n nodes we can generate Catalan number of trees 
## Representation
- using linked list
